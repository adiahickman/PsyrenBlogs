<h3> Welcome to Psyren<h3>
  <p> Life is meant to be cherished, and in the abyss of confusion often surrounding all of us, moments of relaxation can seem far to brief. 
    I am here to live my own life, learn what I can of my surroundings and share what little knowledge I can give back. Psyren serves as a 
    vessel to carry on my passions, and clue my readeres as to what inspires me. So relax, sit back, and read on.</p>
